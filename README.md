This is a demo that I put together for a techtalk I hosted for the [Chattanooga Developer Lunch](http://www.meetup.com/chadevs/) this Summer. I uploaded the [presentation to SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/arcym/introduction-to-meteor-at-chadev-lunch), but I've also included in the techtalk directory, along with my snippets and notes for the demo.

The project itself is a clone of GoogleDocs, to exhibit some of the features that Meteor offers as a framework. :]
